# Advanced Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning 

## Project Overview

"Advanced Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning" is an ongoing project focusing on developing sophisticated machine learning models to identify and predict fraudulent activities in financial transactions. This project utilizes a combination of advanced data processing techniques, machine learning algorithms, and anomaly detection methods to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection systems.

## Project Status: Ongoing

This project is actively being developed and refined. New features, models, and techniques are continually being explored and integrated to improve its performance and adaptability.

## Key Features

1. **Time-Series Feature Engineering**: Implementation of lag features and rolling statistics to capture temporal patterns in transaction data.

2. **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Use of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address the imbalance in datasets typical of fraud detection.

3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - **RandomForestClassifier**: Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.
   - **Neural Network**: Building a neural network with Keras, incorporating dropout layers for regularization.
   - **XGBoost**: Integration of the XGBoost classifier for enhanced predictive capabilities.

4. **Ensemble Modeling**: Development of a soft voting ensemble model that synergistically combines RandomForest, XGBoost, and Neural Network.

5. **Anomaly Detection**: Application of Isolation Forest for detecting outliers, adding an extra layer of fraud detection.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation using ROC AUC score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-Learn, Keras, XGBoost
